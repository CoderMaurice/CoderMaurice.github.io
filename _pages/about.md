<div class="about-bio-text" markdown="1">

<p class="about-bio-status">Work in progress 🛠️ I'm cleaning up the template and adding my content soon. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
I am currently pursuing an **M.S. in Computer Science** at Northern Arizona University.

My research interests are <span class="bio-accent">large language models</span>, <span class="bio-accent">multimodal AI</span>, and <span class="bio-accent">LLM-based agents</span>. I am currently focused on measuring and improving multimodal reasoning and generation, as well as assessing and optimizing agent performance in interactive GUI environments. I am also doing research at the intersection of AI agents and blockchain.

Outside of research, I closely follow financial markets, especially equities and cryptocurrencies.
